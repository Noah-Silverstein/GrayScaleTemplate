        "title": "About Me",
        "description": "I worked in education for many years as a teacher and a teachers' coach. A career change led me to become a life coach and to work in the Jewish community as an educator and tutor. I was very involved as a volunteer in a wide variety of areas in my own community, from teaching Hebrew school to the Religious Affairs Committee, leading services and organizing events. My passion for Jewish studies led me to combine all three fields, resulting in me starting my own business, 'Silver Linings'. <br> <br> I work individually and in small groups, via Zoom or in person. My background in education allows me to tailor my lessons to each student's unique needs and learning styles. I strongly believe in my, 'small steps' curriculum approach, it breaks down complex skills and concepts into smaller, manageable, and achievable learning steps, making learning more accessible and reinforcing success. I see all learning as an opportunity for self-growth. I love to play and I love to learn, and this enthusiasm shines through in my lessons. <br> <br> My love for education and for Jewish learning keeps me going. I have completed a Ba'alei Tefillah training with the Liberal Jewish Community in the UK and a B'nei Mitzvah Teacher Training through the EUPJ (European Union for Progressive Judaism). Currently I am continuing my own studies at EAJL, the European Academy for Jewish Liturgy in the UK. "
