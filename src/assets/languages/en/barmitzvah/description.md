**What makes my teaching special**

**tailored to your needs:** Every learner is different, and I understand that. I customize each lesson to match the individual’s strengths, challenges, and pace.

**The "Small Steps" Curriculum:** My approach breaks down complex concepts into bite-sized, achievable steps. This method builds confidence and ensures progress, making learning accessible and inspiring.

**Learning for Life:** Torah is not just for the moment—it’s about life-long learning. I connect Hebrew and Cantillation to important life skills that will benefit students long after their Bar/Bat Mitzvah.

**Meaningful Text Study:** Torah learning is a journey that is both rich in history and deeply relevant today. Together, we explore the origins of the texts and how they speak to us as liberal Jews in the 21st century.

**Fun & Engaging:** I believe in the power of play and enthusiasm to make learning enjoyable. With a basket full of tools and activities, I ensure that each lesson is not only educational but also fun!

If you're ready for a Bar/Bat Mitzvah experience that's engaging, enriching, and truly personalized, let’s connect! Learning with me is more than just about preparing for a ceremony—it’s about embracing self-growth and building skills that last a lifetime.
