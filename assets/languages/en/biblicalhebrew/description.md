We start from scratch with the Aleph Bet.
As we learn the Hebrew letters and the basics of Hebrew grammar,
we immediately apply it to texts, prayers, songs, and home rituals.
We use a variety of didactic tools online and off-line
This is a hands-on, interactive, and lively course,
no time to get bored!
 
A clear and simple method rooted in the context of Shabbat services and Jewish life.
Syllabus and audio files to help you practice reading at home.
Personal feedback on homework.
Very interactive and highly participatory.

 
"When you learn Hebrew, you learn so much more than just a language.‚Äù
